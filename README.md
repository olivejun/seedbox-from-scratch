## Inspiration

When I originally started playing with this script it was one of the few that actually setup an environment properly for multiple users. I learned what was needed to get it operational and I am now in the process of eliminating all aspects that are server specific. The script should be designed to install into a machine and then have docker services that are geared specifically towards the needs of each user. This script has been heavily modified from the original, but you can upgrade from the original to this version with a little effort. A script may be created later to handle the upgrade process.


## Core Server Features

* Security built into the multiuser web system. Users can only restart their own services and have no access to the system themselves. 
* Backend cron system to handle installation, deletion and service management for all dockers.
* Automatic Update system tied to Github Repository, obtain a patch within minutes of it being deployed.
* A true multi-user enviroment built around core technologies on the server, without actually accessing the server itself. 
* Invidualized docker container services for all user service environments.
* Linux Quota, to control how much space every user can use in your box (disabled by default)
* Central Web Management system to handle user service install/removal/update functionality. 

## Core Server Software

* Web interface for user service interaction
* Fail2ban - to avoid apache and ssh exploits. Fail2ban bans IPs that show malicious signs (disabled by default)
* Apache (SSL)
* OpenVPN 
* OS Specific PHP and PHP-FPM (FastCGI to increase performance)
* Linux Quota
* SSH Server (for SSH terminal and sFTP connections)
* vsftpd (Very Secure FTP Deamon)
* Webmin (use it to manage your users quota)

## Support
Support for this version of the script can be obtained [From This Link HERE](https://www.torrent-invites.com/forum/seedboxes/seedbox-tutorials/270973-multiuser-dockerized-seedbox-from-scratch) While this is based off of the original Seed Box from Scratch it is no longer the same software and the previous support channel will not be able to assist you.


**** Note this is for the older version of the script, which this still leverage's very little. Be careful attempting any fixes from these forums as it likely will have a negative impact on this install. ****

There is no real support for this script, but nerds are talking a lot about it [HERE](http://www.torrent-invites.com/showthread.php?t=272859) and you may find solutions for your problems in that thread.

   - Switched to cromigon/ubooquity since linuxserver/ubooquity wouldn't execute properly

This is outlined here https://denibertovic.com/posts/handling-permissions-with-docker-volumes/
   - Removed Rapisleech, Deluge and SABnxbd from the default installs.
